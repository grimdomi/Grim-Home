Module Search


V4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: introduced a new interface "interface_search_resultobject". Currently used to grant objects the possibility to generate the on-click urls for search-results themselves. If not implemented, the entry is added with a generic edit-action. If this isn't sufficient, implement the interface and decide on your own which url you want to return. #832
BUG: for objects with no string-based properties, the generic backend search could fail due to an erroneous sql query
BUG: fixed the admin / portal element search plugins to build the queries against the new annotation based elements

V4.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: refactored the highlighting of search-phrases. now js-based an no longer generated on the server-side. #794
BUG: fixed search queries for float-values on postgres (aka ignoring them)
BUG: the xml-results skipped the system-id for some detailed pages when generating links, e.g. for news-entries
